# Image Recognition Checkers AI Tutor (Front-End)

This is the front-end portion for an image recognition software for a checkers AI. 

## How to use our project.

To use the Checkers Tutor select a square photo of a checkerboard state that fills the entire screen. Game pieces are only recognized currently if using blue and black game pieces.

The photo will be uploaded to the back-end and generate a response like so  ```(row of piece to move, column of piece to move) (row of WHERE to move piece to, column of WHERE to move piece to)```

Example: ```(2,3) (1, 2)```

## Technologies

Built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and used [React-Native-Image-Picker](https://github.com/react-native-image-picker/react-native-image-picker) to choose photos and camera.
